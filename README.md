# Improved-Cyber-Attack-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This work explores Machine Learning as a viable solution by examining its capabilities to classify malicious traffic in a network. First, a strong data analysis is performed to extracte features from the initial Netflow datasets. All these features are the ncompared with one another through a feature selection process. Then, our approach analyzes five different machine learning algorithms against NetFlow dataset containing common bot-nets
